Ben's e-mail had 4 items to send to authors:

Item 1: dockside size distribution / retained catch
appears to be taken directly from the wikki 
Crab Size Frequency from Retained Catch - QO16 - Species:snow crab - Subdistrict:all - Sampler Type:all - .csv

Item 2: length (size) frequencies by shell condition for:
      tab 1: males and females
      tab 2: legal retained and legal NR
      tab 3: legal and sublegal
   Each of these are direct outputs from the Wikki:
    Species Composition Reports - Size frequency summary
    Fishery: QO16 - Species: snow crab - Report Type: (need all three but do them seperately) - .csv
